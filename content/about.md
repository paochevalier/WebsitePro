After studying in different European cities (Barcelona, Dublin, Lille, Paris, Rostock or Warsaw), I started a doctoral thesis under the joint supervision of [**Caroline Gallez (LVMT)**](https://www.lvmt.fr/equipe/copie-de-copie-de-caroline-gallez-2/), [**Sandrine Wenglenski (LVMT)**](https://www.lvmt.fr/equipe/sandrine-wenglenski/) and [**Juan Antonio MÃ³denes (CED)**](https://ced.uab.cat/es/directori/juan-antonio-modenes-cabrerizo/) in October 2015. The 20th November 2020, I successfully defended my PhD dissertation *A Spatial-Temporal Approach to the Dependence on Mobility in the metropolises of Barcelona and Aix-Marseille-Provence*. 

In January 2021, I began a new journey within the company [**Kisio**](https://kisio.com/) in Lyon (France) where I continue my research agenda as well as working for a better understanding of GPS data in order to learn about individual daily mobility. 

In my professional website, you will find some posts I wrote in my blog, some examples of data visualisation I produced, my resume updated and a list of my scientific publications. Also, you have some direct links to my social media accounts and to the code I used to build this website (Github repository). Do not hesitate to contact me **(paol.chevalier@gmail.com)** for questions or projects you have in mind and I could be interested to participate!
