**Kind of scientific publication** : Chapter of a scientific book

**Abstract**: This article focuses on low-income workers who spend more than 90 minutes a day commuting between their place of residence and their workplace(s) in the metropolitan areas of Marseille and Barcelona. These workers typically require a longer commuting time per day than the rest of the population and, at the same time, they have limited economic resources to afford the said commute. To understand why these long commutes can be considered another dimension of inequality for low-income workers, some information on a qualitative sample of long commuters has been collected. First, GPS tracking was carried out to map their residential space, offering a great understanding of their daily routines. This map was also used to prepare a semi-structured interview and to adapt the questionnaire to the mobility practices observed during a week for each of the 44 individuals in the survey.
