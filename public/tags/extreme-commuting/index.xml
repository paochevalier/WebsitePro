Abstract: This article focuses on low-income workers who spend more than 90 minutes a day commuting between their place of residence and their workplace(s) in the metropolitan areas of Marseille and Barcelona. These workers typically require a longer commuting time per day than the rest of the population and, at the same time, they have limited economic resources to afford the said commute.</description>
